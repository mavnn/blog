#+TITLE: ADHD and me
#+DATE: 2022-10-14

This morning, I did the washing up.

Now: your first response might be "Michael: why do I care? Do I look like a
washing up blog reader?"

But that would miss the point. This morning I did the washing up, and only the
washing up. I didn't procrastinate with some Twitter or YouTube videos first. I
didn't need to listen to a podcast at the same time to avoid getting lost
staring off into space thinking about something completely different.

Most importantly: no crushing feeling of overwhelm about needing to do this task
that both feels insurmountable but is obviously (objectively) trivial. It's
embarrassing to admit that I've been repeatedly reduced to tears by the need to
do the washing up.

This change, it appears, is the impact of methylphenidate (RitalinÂ®) on my
brain. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, and yesterday I undertook a series of
"challenge tests" to see if I am one of the [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732009/][75% of adult's with ADHD whose
symptoms are helped by the drug]].

I did the same series of tests twice: once in the morning, before taking
methylphenidate; the other in the afternoon an hour after taking the first trial
intake under observation (methylphenidate is a controlled substance here in
Italy).

It was a strange, and almost disturbing, experience to feel me brain acting
differently. Recall being smoother, free association on a topic becoming easier
because my brain stayed on /that/ topic, not generating side lines that needed
to be discarded. That they were still my thoughts, but with less in the way.

You see: trying to do stuff (and by stuff I mean pretty much /anything/ that you
need to choose to do, rather than that you happen to start because it distracted
you...) with ADHD is hard. I didn't realize how hard until some of that effort
was lifted.

The closest I've come to being able to describe it is that having ADHD is like
your brain wearing an ancient near eastern tunic to work a farm.

Ever hear the phrase "gird your loins"? It's the [[https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/manly-know-how/how-to-gird-up-your-loins-an-illustrated-guide/][process of tying up your tunic]]
(designed primarily to keep you cool) so that you can run, or fight, or carry
out hard physical labour at ground level without the 'skirt' of the tunic
getting in the way and tripping you up.

That is my brain: I need to put effort into preparing to do things before I can
even start doing them. So it takes effort just to /get ready to start/. And if
you make a mistake in the girding, or the knot slips? Well, now you're half way
through your task with a bunch of cloth swishing around your legs and getting in
the way.

Methylphenidate is the equivalent of putting on jeans. You can be casual still,
but you can also just... do stuff? Finish your morning coffee, look across the
kitchen, and go: "I need to do the washing up."

This morning, I did the washing up.
