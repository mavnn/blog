#+TITLE: ADHD and me

This morning, I did the washing up.

Now: your first response might be "Michael: why do I care? Do I look like a
washing up blog reader?"

But that would miss the point. This morning I did the washing up, and only the
washing up. I didn't procrastinate with some Twitter or YouTube videos first. I
didn't need to listen to a podcast at the same time to avoid getting lost
staring off into space thinking about something completely different.

Most importantly: no crushing feeling of overwhelm about needing to do this task
that both feels insurmountable but is obviously (objectively) trivial. It's
embarrassing to admit that I've been repeatedly reduced to tears by the need to
do the washing up.

This change, it appears, is the impact of methylphenidate (RitalinÂ®) on my
brain. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, and yesterday I undertook a series of
"challenge tests" to see if I am one of the [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732009/][75% of adult's with ADHD whose
symptoms are helped by the drug]].

I did the same series of tests twice: once in the morning, before taking
methylphenidate; the other in the afternoon an hour after taking the first trial
intake under observation (methylphenidate is a controlled substance here in
Italy).

It was a strange, and almost disturbing, experience to feel my brain acting
differently. Recall was smoother. Free association on a topic easier because my
brain stayed on /that/ topic, without veering away onto side lines that I needed
to filter out from what I was saying.. My thoughts were still my own, but
with... less in the way.

You see: trying to do stuff (and by stuff I mean pretty much /anything/ that you
need to choose to do, rather than that you happen to start because it distracted
you...) with ADHD is hard. I didn't realize how hard until some of that effort
was lifted.

The closest I've come to being able to describe it is that having ADHD is like
your brain wearing an ancient near eastern tunic to work a farm.

Ever hear the phrase "gird your loins"? It's the [[https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/manly-know-how/how-to-gird-up-your-loins-an-illustrated-guide/][process of tying up your tunic]]
(designed primarily to keep you cool) so that you can run, or fight, or carry
out hard physical labour at ground level without the 'skirt' of the tunic
getting in the way and tripping you up.

My brain wears a tunic: I need to put effort into preparing to do things before
I can even start doing them. So it takes energy and effort just to /get ready to
start/. And if you make a mistake in the girding, or the knot slips? Well, now
you're half way through your task with a bunch of cloth swishing around your
legs and getting in the way.

Methylphenidate is the equivalent of putting on jeans.[fn:1] You can be casual still,
but you can also just... do stuff? Finish your morning coffee, look across the
kitchen, and go: "I need to do the washing up."

This morning, I did the washing up.

[fn:1] Very short lived jeans, at the moment. While slow release versions are
available, the version of methylphenidate used while experimenting to find the
ideal personal dose has an effect period of about 4-6 hours at the outside and
I'm only prescribed one dose a day. So I still get to wear a brain tunic in the
afternoons until I reach a stable enough dosage to take the slow release
version.
