This is just a short test; I'm beginning to publish my blog via Emacs Org mode rather than Jekyll because... well, because I don't enjoy updating Ruby, and blogging is something that I (partially) do for my own relaxation and enjoyment.

So... welcome to the new blog. To those few of you subscribed to my blog as a feed, apologies for the largely content free post.

If this works I'll be updating as I go along with actual posts, as well as the obligatory posts on how the blog works and why I've set it up as I'm planning to.

Remind me why every developer feels the need to do that, again?
